# physics-sim
a simple physics sim which supports only ball collision, gravity, friction and a command panel, i have plans to add rigid bodies, other shapes and rotations later

features:
  1.gravity
  2.friction
  3.air resistance
  4.collisions
  5.spawn circles using a command panel

command panel usage:

right now theres only one command: spawn
spawn command is used to spawn objects
syntax for spawinign a circls:

spawn circls x x-value y y-value xv x-plane-speed yv y-plane-velocity mass mass-value color color-value name object-name

order doesnt matter
